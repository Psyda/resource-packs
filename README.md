# Psyda's Sand Casino

This is the most gaudy resourcepack you'll find. Enjoy flashing your wealth with this obnoxious pack - Show off your vast wealth with this pack. If you lose your bank in the sand casino while using this skin and send me a clip I'll feel obligated to make a bronze version of the theme for you.

To use this Resource Pack you must first install Runelite, as well as the external plugin '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' from the plugin hub.

You should be able to download the pack from directly within the plugin.

**Note:** *Some textures are still missing, this is due to the current version of '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' (v1.0.5) not supporting said textures, I will update this resource-pack as new versions of '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' are released.*

As more functionality is added to the resource packs, I'd like to add a lot more quirks to the theme making it more unique.
